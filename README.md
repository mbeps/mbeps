# üëã Hi there! I'm Maruf  
I hold a First-Class Honours degree in Computer Science from Royal Holloway University of London. I have proven experience working with Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and have expertise in managing and designing both relational and non-relational databases. Additionally, I have a strong foundation in various Mathematical disciplines, including Algebra, Calculus, Statistics and more . Currently, I serve as a DevOps engineer at Commerzbank, where my responsibilities also encompass Software Engineering.

I participated in several projects that have honed my skills across software and web development, Machine Learning, and software engineering processes. Notable projects include Circus Discussions, a social media platform built with TypeScript, Next.js, React, and Firebase, featuring CI/CD pipelines and Docker for efficient deployments. Another is a Machine Learning endeavour, the House Price Prediction project, where I used algorithms like Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regressors to predict housing prices in California, utilising tools such as Scikit Learn, Pandas and more. Additionally, I contributed to Noodle, a student learning platform, where I managed team tasks and timelines, enhancing my leadership and organizational skills. These experiences have been crucial in developing my ability to produce high-quality, well-documented, and tested code.

In addition to my formal education, I've enriched my knowledge and skills through various online courses covering programming, software engineering, web development, machine learning, AI, DevOps, and mathematics. These courses have been vital for both my career and personal projects. I actively contributed to the GNOME Foundation, particularly in the development of the quick settings feature for GNOME 43, providing valuable feedback, mockups, and engaging in community discussions. Furthermore, I participated in the Google X RHUL Developers Club, collaborating on web development projects with fellow students. These experiences have deepened my understanding and practical skills in a collaborative, real-world environment.

My diverse roles have honed my abilities in communication, task management, time management, problem-solving, and planning. Currently, I work at Commerzbank as a DevOps and software engineer, where my role as a team leader has been essential in developing my collaboration and leadership skills. Additionally, my experience as a Maths tutor has strengthened my communication skills, enabling me to effectively interact not only with students but also with their parents. These experiences collectively underscore my proficiency in both technical and soft skills, vital for my professional growth.
